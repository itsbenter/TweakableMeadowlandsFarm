## FAQ

1. Can I use this mod in an ongoing save? <br>
Yes, you can! However, if you remove ponds, pond area will be an empty plot as default debris generation only occur during save file creation.
2. Can I remove this mod after using it in my save?
Yes, you can. The patch will not apply (ie. game will use default map). There's possibility of buildings or items on top of the pond. Especially if a pond was removed using the mod. Still, easily dealt with Noclip Mode.
3. Can I use this mod in multiplayer?
Yes, you can. Ideally with mod installed and with same setting on all players. Otherwise, you might see other farmer walking on water.
